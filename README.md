### Backlog Ordering Rationale
To efficiently order our backlog we started out with writing out a foundation of user stories that we believed accurately covered the primary functionality of the application, TradeTalk. Based on their similarities, the user stories were grouped into three main epics. The epics are user registration, stock search & display, and automatic buy and sell signal. The three epics were prioritized based on the logical ordering of how they will be delivered. We believe this backlog ordering rationale will help us develop the primary functionalities of TradeTalk and continue to add/change features with each iteration.
